# pythonWithfewProjects
This is project based learning of python programming language. This learning was done sortly after finishing exam of IV semester  .So due to such frustating mindsets and long examination of nearly a month some offensive words might have been used in this learning . I hope whoever is reading don't mind and judge me.
Using some python libraries.
Having fun and Enjoying learning these stuffs
