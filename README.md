# pythonWithfewProjects
This is project based learning of python programming language. This learning was done sortly after finishing exam of IV semester  .So due to such frustating mindsets and long examination of nearly a month some offensive words might have been used in this learning . I hope whoever is reading don't mind.

Had fun learning these stuffs and hope readers to have fun
